  The expense of setting up and maintaining a website can add up quickly, so
  picking the best free web hosting provider for your needs can help cut costs.
  But be careful, as we found that out of a list of 18 free website providers
  that we compiled, only eight of them – less than half, in other words –
  actually delivered the goods.

Out of 18 free web hosting providers, Infinityfree is our recommended choice with Byethost, Googiehost, 000Webhost, FreeHostingNoAds, and FreeWebHostingArea being the other options.

Because you are provided with a free service, the obligations usually attached to a paid subscription no longer exist, and you are usually left to your own devices when things go wrong. None of the free web hosting providers that passed our test could measure up with even the cheapest paid-for service on the market.

But there’s worse news still. We discovered that the websites of some free web hosting providers were not properly secured, which doesn’t generate much faith in their ability to deliver the level of service you’d expect from paid-for providers. Remember the old adage, ‘you get what you pay for’? Well, nowhere else in the tech business is this truer than with web hosting.
